# WordPress Docker Development Environment

This repository contains the necessary Dockerfile and Docker Compose configuration to set up a local WordPress development environment using Docker, Xdebug, and PhpStorm.

The setup includes the official WordPress Docker image, enhanced with Xdebug and WP-CLI for debugging and command-line operations, respectively. The Docker Compose configuration spins up two services: WordPress and MySQL.

To understand how to use this setup for your local WordPress development, please refer to the comprehensive [blog post](https://wpml.org/?p=1379666) that walks you through each step.

Feel free to pull this code, try it out, and suggest improvements!

Happy coding!
